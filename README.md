## Preamble

The objective of the project is to develop a graphic editor offering similar functionalities to those provided by well known software (eg Dia, Inkscape or MSPaint).
The editor that is designed in this work will allow to draw geometric shapes such as lines, ellipses, circles and stars.
To program this application, we will follow the software architectural pattern Model-View-Controller (MVC). This architecture specifies a methodology to facilitate the development of an interactive graphic application.
